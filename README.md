# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview:
  
  In this project, we analyzed a datafile of schools in a district for Maria, who is the data scientist for the district. We worked on the datafile to adjust for the academic dishonesty that could target certain students and analyzed the budget and success of the schools by their type. We mainly focused on the areas below:
  
  
          1. Get the scores of ninth grade in Thomas High School out of the equation for standardization.
          2. Find out the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools while taking the overall passing percentage into account.
          3. Find out budget spending per school type and size, and per capita spending.
  
  
  The major results we derived from the analysis are the following:

          1. There are a total number of 15 schools and 39,170 students with a total spending of $24,649,428 for the district. The overall passing percentage (math and reading) is 65 percent. 
          
          2. Our findindgs show that all the top 5 performing schools, in terms of overall passing percentage, are charter schools with an impressive over 90 percent of their students passing. The bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools. 
          
          3. Interestingly, the overall and per capital budget for the district schools are considerably higher than the charter schools. The top performing school is among the category with the lowest per capita spending. Our analysis shows that the highest the per capita and overall spending, the lower the overall passing percentage. 
          
          4. The number of students in a school was also one of the main factors in this analysis. Schools that have less than 2,000 students, around 90 percent of their students pass. Schools that have over 2,000 students, only 58 percent of their students pass their reading and math exams. 

## Results and summary:

  After the changes in school district metrics here are the difference that we got from the analysis:
  
  1. The district summary
      
      The average math score dropped by 0.1 points while the average reading score stayed the same. The percentage of students passing math dropped by .2% and the percentage of students passing reading dropped by .3%. The overall passing percentage didn't change.

  2. The school summary

      The only major change is with Thomas High School. Ther overall passing percentage dropped from 91 percent to 65 percent.


  3. Effect of removing the ninth gradersâ€™ math and reading scores from Thomas High School.

      Nothing changed in the output.


  4. Effect of removing 9th graders from Thomas High school on scores, budget etc

     
      Thomas High School's (THS) 9th grade class has no math or reading score data to count. Everything else was unaffected.

      Scores by school spending did not change.
      Scores by size did not change either.
      Scores by school type did not see any change as well.
